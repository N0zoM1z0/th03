# TH03 — current next-agent handoff (2026-11-07)

**Start here.** This is the active short handoff; detailed per-experiment
history through after709 was moved, unchanged in substance, to
[RE_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_AFTER709.md](RE_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_AFTER709.md).
Older roots are [after596](RE_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_AFTER596.md) and
[after554](RE_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_AFTER554.md). **Do not treat historical
“latest” paragraphs as current state.** Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
and [the workflow](RE_WORKFLOW.md) before modifying native evidence.

## Current verified checkpoint — what it proves, and what it does not

- **Latest current-source affected-scope MAIN proof: `af715a`.** Two
  independent original TC4 4.02 / TLINK rounds rebuilt **four complete
  changed original physical TUs** together: Yumemi and Chiyuri **major
  BOSSes**, entire main **entry/stage/frame scheduler**, and all four CPU
  direction/target/dodge functions. All **9,139 CODE bytes, 1,221 literal
  ordered native FIXUPPs and 33 PUBLIC offsets**, native source dependencies,
  original normal MAIN/MAP and both Japanese loaded programs/1,553 ordered MZ
  relocations matched. 95 other original project objects and original CRT
  were reused, **not recompiled**. Independent standard MZ serialization
  reproduces the complete original 130,882-byte Japanese MAIN.EXE.
- **New source-binding route:** the scoped native compiler now accepts the
  full `entry` physical TU, rooted in current maintained `entry.cpp` and
  four explicitly checked included `.inl` bodies. This avoids accidental
  reuse of a stale old round-loop implementation. The source has new named
  `0/1/2` outcome states, 16-bit frame timers, natural guard checks.
  Yumemi, Chiyuri and CPU control, collision and rendering paths likewise
  have native-exact natural C++ and original temporal/subpixel semantics.
- **Previous after709 proof remains separately retained:** `af709a`
  rebuilt five original Kana/split-shared-BOSS/core/lose TUs (6,622 CODE,
  701 ordered FIXUPPs and 42 PUBLICs) in two rounds, with original MAIN/MAP
  and loaded-image checks. The **historical after709 accumulated union**
  covered **58 original physical source TUs, 66,407 CODE bytes, 7,303
  fixups and 367 PUBLICs**. These are a historical deduplicated union of
  separate native proofs, **not** a simultaneous 58-object compiler run or
  an independently recomputed after715 coverage figure. Entry had already
  been source-proved historically in after594; no duplicate distinct-owner
  count is claimed here.
- **Frozen parent/full MAIN:** ordinary after596 original 99-object source-
  native TLINK is still the unchanged parent. The direct TLINK DOS header
  differs from the original Japanese executable; the separately normalized
  MZ serializer matches the file. Neither step proves historical raw
  vendor OMF record identity, whole-product source ownership or canonical
  packed-file Factory acceptance.
- **MAINL remains distinct:** the historical after587 decoded ending EXE,
  MAP and 677 relocations remain retained, but current source-bound decoded
  publication is **PENDING** after later source changes invalidated an old
  input guard. Do not advertise that historical proof as current
  acceptance. OP/ZUN have their own retained decoded evidence and
  outstanding canonical packed-file/whole-product claims.

Read [the combined after715 four-source review](MAIN_FOUR_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_AFTER715_REVIEW.md)
and [the after709 five-source review](MAIN_FIFTYEIGHT_SCOPED_SOURCE_AFTER709_REVIEW.md)
for exact scopes, controls, provenance and replay limitations.

### Fast, non-rebuilding verification

From the repository root (keep the original Japanese pinned targets):

```sh
git status -sb
.venv/bin/python scripts/preflight.py
PYTHONPATH=scripts .venv/bin/python scripts/review_th03_main_source_overlay.py --stage af715a
PYTHONPATH=scripts .venv/bin/python scripts/review_th03_main_source_overlay.py --stage af709a
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_tracking.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/progress.py --check
git diff --check
```

The latest protected read-only proof root is
`.analysis/work/exatt-layout-af715a/report.json`, including both actual
rounds and source/inlined dependency snapshots.
Evidence roots (ignored but **protected**) also include
`.analysis/work/exatt-layout-af709a/report.json` plus its actual
two-round OBJ, EXE, MAP, writer logs, source/header snapshots and
the `TH03WORK/probe/af709a` compiler worktree. Other relevant
receipts: `af703a` (7 edited TUs), `af693a` (6 edited TUs),
`af686a` (47 selected TUs) and frozen after596 MAIN.
Review the [after715 native integration report](MAIN_FOUR_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_AFTER715_REVIEW.md)
and the [after709 cumulative report](MAIN_FIFTYEIGHT_SCOPED_SOURCE_AFTER709_REVIEW.md)
for numbers, limits and exact commands. A new rebuild needs a **fresh
DOS-safe stage ID**; do not overwrite prior receipts.

## Do the next actual reconstruction work

1. Prioritize **unproved physical owner/ABI scopes and substantial
   BOSS/player functions**, with the small leaves that feed them;
   don't spend a turn re-counting already source-owned CODE.
   The 58-TU native proof union is **not** all 99 project TUs.
2. Challenge old source comments and v1 results. Original-byte
   exactness requires current maintained compiler-consumed source
   (emitted Borland OMF COMENT dependency), complete CODE and
   initialized DATA, literal ordered FIXUPPs, PUBLICs,
   segment/BSS ownership, real TLINK response and full MAIN/MAP.
   Equivalent math may produce different TC4 bytes; preserve
   signedness, operation order, 16-bit widths, register and
   near/far/Pascal ABI, RNG consumption and original bugs.
3. Use `scripts/probe_th03_main_exatt_layout.py --stage NEW --units a,b`
   to rebuild **only affected original TUs**, and
   `scripts/review_th03_main_source_overlay.py --stage NEW`
   for independent review. Reuse unchanged source-native
   objects and libraries in the original 99-object TLINK.
   Do not run another whole cold replay for routine source edits.
4. Consider the **MAINL current publication gate** separately:
   the after587 source/native evidence is historical, not a
   current signed-off decoded acceptance. Diagnose its exact source
   guard and re-review only affected dependency inputs rather than
   repinning original receipt hashes.
5. Commit each substantive verified improvement `gpt-web: xxx`,
   preserve rejected experiments and both original compiler rounds.
   Don't push without a request.

### Known physical-source traps

- `core` uses original link slot `probe/af593p/rN/core.obj`;
  `ch_setup` uses `probe/af592p/rN/ch_setup.obj`.
  `chain1/chain2` originals are in `obj/`, **not**
  `obj/th03/`. Yumemi Bomb's compiler shortname is
  `bomb~cxk` despite its original linker slot's long filename.
- `combo.cpp` physically emits two original TUs:
  `p_combo` (score/HUD) and `p_cmbhl` (fireball/BOSS/
  panic helpers). The original BOSS `shared.cpp` also emits
  two TUs (`ba_sring`/`ba_srest`). Compiler flags and
  original MAP module row counts are not interchangeable.
- Certain character Bomb `CODE` producers have **zero private BSS**:
  storage is owned by external frozen carriers. Recompiling with
  duplicate BSS changes relocation fields even when CODE sizes match.
- The active scoped compiler binds current `hyper.inl` and
  all four loss/defeat `.inl` bodies with explicit source
  snapshots and OMF dependency checks. It does **not**
  claim every other nested `.inl` in the core is newly
  modified or independently source-bound.
- Do not simplify an original `& 3` to `% 4`,
  prefix/postfix byte mutation or an original
  AL/AX/BX intermediate **without a full native comparison**.
  Multiple exact negative controls are documented.

## Storage and handoff discipline

The ignored `.analysis` contains the source-native receipt DAG,
both round outputs, original private toolchains and Japanese
targets. Do **not** delete by age or run
`clean_generated.py --prune-unreferenced-receipts`.
The current restricted policy and measured audits are in
[STORAGE_HANDOFF_CURRENT.md](STORAGE_HANDOFF_CURRENT.md).
Only verified disposable stage outputs and regenerable caches
may be removed; preserve an audit manifest with hashes before
deleting any bounded failed scratch stage.

For historical details and **negative codegen experiments**, use
[the archived chronology](RE_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_AFTER709.md)
and the relevant `docs/MAIN_*_AFTER*_REVIEW.md`.
Avoid re-expanding this live handoff into a one-section-per-commit log.
